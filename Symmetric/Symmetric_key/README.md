# Symmetric Encryption With Key
## 1. How To Use
### 1.1 Generate a Key
#### Run [Generate_Key.py](https://github.com/ghilmanaji/Simple-PyCryption/blob/main/Generate_Key.py) to generate a key to encrypt and decrypt the file
### 1.2 How to ecnrypt
#### 1.2.1 Insert your all file and folders on [Input_Encrypt](https://github.com/ghilmanaji/Simple-PyCryption/tree/main/Input_Encrypt)
