# Symmetric
## 1 What is it?
Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption where only one key (a secret key) is used to both encrypt and decrypt electronic data.

The entities communicating via symmetric encryption must exchange the key so that it can be used in the decryption process.

This encryption method differs from asymmetric encryption where a pair of keys - one public and one private - is used to encrypt and decrypt messages.
